When did your kids start picking out their own clothes From winnie.com
Toddlers often don�t have the words to tell you when an itchy sweater or scratchy tag is bothering them. Before your kiddo masters the art of dressing, you should expect her to undress first and take off socks, shoes, and pants. Push one leg at a time through the leg holes while also holding pants. Make them take responsibility for their mess, just as you would have them clean up toys, etc.
