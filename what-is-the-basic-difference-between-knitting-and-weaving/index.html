<p>The strength of warp knitting fabrics may be increased by using yarns of strong fibers, yarns of balanced construction, and a high gage with strong free yarns. Weaving is a method of textile production in which two distinct sets of yarns or threads are interlaced at right angles to form a fabric or cloth. Spinning and weaving are both critical components of turning raw materials into usable fabrics. Each stitch is produced by pulling a new loop through and existing loop.</p>
