Of course you can do anything with a ss including crosscuttiing plywood, but then i could build a kitchens worth of nice cabinets with a skill saw as well. The average price for â50s and â60s models is between $500 and $800, while the common asking price for â70s and â80s versions is around $1,500 to more than $2,000. Shopsmith tools were made in san francisco by magna engineering corp.</p>
<h3 id="can-be-a-bitch-to-set">(Can Be A Bitch To Set.)</h3><p>The ss is great for a craft oriented hobbiest. Shopsmith has issues and could be a better company if the owners wife stepped away. A problem to quality work is the table not being aligned. Shopsmith long ago recognized the desire to use some of the tools in a freestanding form and sold a separate stand or mount for them.</p>

There are differences between the tools comprising the ss set and any of the other single use tools. Or am i better off spend the 3k on separate tools? Are they any good for a beginner/intermediate woodworker?</p>
