The curious chemical soup that is “magic tape” ( what’s inside the secret recipe for scotch magic tape) is certainly not going to cause additional harm to your slightly damaged cable. But it�s at best a temporary fix… the tape isn�t rugged enough to last long. Electrical tape works best when it conforms to the object it is being applied to. 3ds charger cord got chewed apart would it be safe just to tape back together and keep using it or should i just get a new one?
