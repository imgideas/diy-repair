Shopsmith Mark 5 Setup w/Table Saw/ Lathe 33142 eBay From ebay.com
Also, while looking at woodworking sites, just ensure it is a 5/8 bore with a set screw. The right side is setup for the saw blades, safety equipment, and a few common accessories to have them right with the shopsmith. If you can get one at a steal of a price, then it is a great tool. I haven�t even started turning yet and i had a question about a longer lathe setup.
